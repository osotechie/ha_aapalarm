### Home Assistant - Custom Integration - Arrowhead Alarm System

</div>

---

## üìñ Overview

This is a HACS integration for Arrowhead Alarm Systems, allowing you to integrate your AAP alarm into Home Assistant, giving you access to control your alarm panel, outputs and use zone sensors in your home automations.

To use this integration with Home Assistant you must have an AAP alarm with one of the following modules to allow this integration to communicate with your alarm:

- AAP Elite ESL-2 based PCB
- AAP Elite ESL-2 IoT / APP POD [link](https://www.aap.co.nz/shop/Alarm+Systems/Modules/ESL-2+IoT.html), or
- AAP RS232-BD [link](https://www.aap.co.nz/shop/Alarm+Systems/Modules/RS232-BD.html)

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> The firmware for the APP Elite ESL-2 IOT / APP module needs to be `Ver 2.10.3628 2017 Oct 20 09:48:43`. Contact AAP Support to request exact firmware version [email](mailto:tech@aap.co.nz)

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> *This integration has not yet been tested with any newer Arrowhead Alarm System units like those powered by the EliteControl. It may work with the [EC-i RS232](https://www.aap.co.nz/shop/Alarm+Systems/Modules/EC-i+RS232.html) module.*

This is a custom component for Arrowhead Home Alarm System using the IP / Serial module to integrate with Home Assistant.


## üíΩ Installation

### HACS Based Install

If you are using HACS to manage custom components in your Home Assistant installation you can easily add this repo as a custom repo in HACS.

  1. Navigate to the **HACS** console within **Home Assistant**
  2. Click the **3 dots** in the upper right corner
  3. Select **Custom repositories**
  4. Use the below information to add this repo to HACS
   
      - Repository:   `https://github.com/osotechie/ha_aapalarm`
      - Type:         `integration`
  
  5. Restart Home Assistant
  
### Manual Install

  1. Create custom_components folder if it does not exist to get following structure\
     `config/custom_components`

  2. Create `aaplarm` folder inside the **custom_components** folder
     `config/custom_components/aapalarm`

  3. Download a copy of this repo, and copy all files from [custom_components/aapalarm/](custom_components/aapalarm/) into the previously created folder
  
  4. Restart Home Assistant

## üóíÔ∏èConfiguration

Below is an example of the configuration you need to add to your Home Assistant `Configuration.yaml` file.

```
