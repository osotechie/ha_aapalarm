### Home Assistant - Custom Integration - Arrowhead Alarm System

### 2024.11.24 - Initial Release

### 2024.11.30 - Add UI Configuration for setup of Integration

- Updated integration to support config flows to allow setup of integration via the UI, instead of via YAML

NOTES:
- Config Flow still requires a bit of tweaking, but replicates the functionality of the YAML (just needs some tweaks to display names etc)

ISSUES:
- For some reason the entities created are not associated with a single device or the entry within the Integration in HA
